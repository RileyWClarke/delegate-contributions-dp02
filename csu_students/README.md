Contact Author: Louise Edwards ledwar04@calpoly.edu<br>
Last verified to run: 2023-06-02<br>
Targeted learning level: beginner<br>
Credit: The notebook utilizes aspects from tutorial notebooks 1-8<br>

Description: 
The purpose of the notebook is to use the Truth Summary catalog from DP0 DC2 to query nearby, bright galaxy clusters.
Within the notebook, you'll see how to porgram a simple equation, as well as make color images, and overplot a circle on an image.
You will identify brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and then use the distance and estimated total mass of the galaxy to determine the Einstein radius.
