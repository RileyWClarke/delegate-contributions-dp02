    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of us (DP0 delegates, stack club members, and RSP support personnel) were curious about how well SOA LLMs could aid in generating code for our RSP Jupyter Notebooks.The difference between our expectations and the actual capability of the LLM(s) were sometimes quite different.\n",
    "We were able to generate Python code snippets using several chatbot LLM models, which saved us time and increased our productivity, we also discovered that human review is still necessary to ensure that the generated code is accurate and meets the desired specifications. \n",
    "Remarkably, we learned that we had to adjust our approach in communicating with the LLMs. Initially, we would ask questions or provide instructions in a more conversational manner, similar to how we would interact with a human colleague. However, we found that the LLMs responded more accurately and effectively when we gave more explicit, detailed, and technical instructions. This often meant breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps and specifying the desired output format or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to: <br>\n",
    "1. Explore various LLM chatbot models in conjunction with RSP Jupyter Notebooks<br>\n",
    "2. Demonstrate and exercise ten skills relative to Notebooks being developed for RSP and outside use<br>\n",
    "3. Visualize an inproved speed of software generation capable with new LLMs and chatbots specifically<br>"
