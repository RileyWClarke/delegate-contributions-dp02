# nuclear

Created by: K. Decker French (UIUC)

This notebook demonstrates an example science case investigating nuclear transients in galaxies. The simulated dataset in DP0.2 does not contain AGN variability or Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), so we can use the data to characterize the underlying noise that will be present in real lightcurves of galaxy nuclei. This notebook also shows an example of using host galaxy properties to divide up variable sources to look at correlations with host galaxy color.

Questions, suggestions, and contributions welcome!
