All are welcome to contribute notebooks to this directory.

Just add a line to the table below for every file added.

| File | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|
| simple_pz_training_set.ipynb | Use the DC2 `TruthSummary` table to create a training set of about 300,000 galaxies in a small area of the DC2 region with known redshifts and ugrizy photometry with observed apparent magnitude errors that represent the 10-year depth of the wide-fast-deep area. | Melissa Graham |


# note

These notebooks will not work with the DP0.1 data set.
