# this folder is for materials related to solutions to command line optional exercises from tutorial 9a

The command line version of the DP0.2 custom coadd tutorial (9a) is available at:

https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/cmdline-custom-coadd.html

In that DP0.2 command line custom coadd tutorial, there are five optional exercises for the learner, four of which are command line optional exercises. This folder contains "solutions" for the four command line optional exercises (but not the fifth optional exercise which is meant to be done within a Jupyter notebook).
