## Warning

The solutions to this command line tutorial, like the corresponding command line tutorial itself, need to be run using LSST pipelines version `w_2022_40`. For further elaboration on this important point, [see the relevant DP0.2 command line tutorial](https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/cmdline-custom-coadd.html).

Note also that the very first optional exercise from the DP0.2 command line custom coadd tutorial is a Jupyter notebook optional exercise rather than a command line optional exercise, and therefore no solution for that optional exercise is provided here.

## First command line optional exercise

## Second command line optional exercise

## Third command line optional exercise

## Fourth command line optional exercise
