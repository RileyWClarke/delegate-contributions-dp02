Notes from chat after delegate assembly presentation:

**Please feel free to update the MW halo notebook, or to adapt it for other purposes, then contribute to this repo!

Future explorations:

- Add errors to data points in density profile
- Use a more robust/proper polynomial fitting technique (see, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062)
- Try with RR Lyrae
- MSTO stars a la Juric+ papers
- Other tracers?
- Compare Trilegal to galfast models
- Fold in things like contamination, biases due to abs mag relation uncertainties, etc.
- Transform the abs mag - color relation from SDSS system to LSST (using Doug's and Jen's transformations?)

- Year 1 proper motions? (is anyone working on using DES/DELVE as 1st epoch for pxs and pms?)
